        <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>

        <p>
            <strong><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a></strong>[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:15px;">
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] 
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
            It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
